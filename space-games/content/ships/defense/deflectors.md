# Deflectors

Deflectors are one step below shields - they use electronically charged hull regions to deflect incoming
attacks.

# Effectiveness

Ranged weapons impacting at oblique angles have a higher chance of effective deflection.

Deflecton is not a 100% effective defence, with some damage being absorbed by the ship's hull.

# Charge

Deflectors loose charge (like shields) when absorbing impacts, and eventually fail.

Deflectors are less effective when their charge is low.

Deflectors recharge at a constant rate, depending on the power generation capabilities of the ship.
