# Reactive Armour

Reactive armour uses sensors and tightly packed explosives to detonate incoming ballistic charges before
they have an opportunity to inflict direct damage.

## Limited Uses

Reactive armour is only good for a specific number of usages - after the armour is expended,
the ship is vulnerable to attack.
