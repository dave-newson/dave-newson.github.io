# Point Defence Turrets

Point defense turrets are small turrets dotted around the hull of larger ships, usually firing
a range of fighter-class weaponry or general-purpose flak.

## Targets

Turrets normally target projectiles (missiles) and fighter craft within a short range.

Turrets can elect to fire on capital ships within a slightly extended range, if they have nothing else to do.

## Turret Locations

Turrets should exist in specific locations dotted around the ship.

## Cool-down

Turrets cannot be fired indefinitely - they can only fire in bursts and must cool down between firings.

## Targetting

Where multiple targets exist, turrets should endeavour to split the target list between turrets,
avoiding the issue of all turrets targetting the same specific incoming projectile.

# Sweep Attack

Turret attacks should "sweep" the target area, firing in a line across the intended target.
