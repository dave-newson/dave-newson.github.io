# Basic Damage System

A unit has a fixed number of health points, which is usually a simple number represented by a health bar.

As a unit receives damage, the unit's health decreases. When the unit's health reaches zero, the unit is destroyed.

## Repair

Where a shit can be repaired, the repair points are simply fed into the health value of the ship, until it
is returned to full health.
