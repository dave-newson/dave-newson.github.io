# Space Planes

Space Planes is a common term for space ships that behave and maneuver similar to regular aircraft in atmosphere.

## Space ships vs Aircraft

In space there is no gravity, no air resistance, and things tend to travel in very simply ballistic straight lines.

For ships with have only a single main engine, turning or decelerating means facing your engine towards the current
direction of travel, and then firing the engine to slow down or otherwise maneuver the ship.

This creates very boring and reliable movement patterns, which isn't at all fun or interesting for players.

Aircraft on the other hand can perform a wide variety of maneuvers, with interesting ballistics and movement
that's fun for players.  This is a very simple, real reason to make space ships behave like aircraft instead of
like space ships!
