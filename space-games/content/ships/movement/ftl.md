# Faster Than Light (FTL)

Lots of different types of FTL exist; let's concentrate on the most common types.

## Instant FTL

Instant FTL is usually preceded by some small indicator (sound, light effect) and the ship
then instantly disappears.

Ships using instant FTL can usually jump in any situation, including combat.

Ships jumping in this manner usually can't be followed, as there's no indicator of their destination.

Seen in:
 - Battlestar Galactica
 - Star Trek Discovery Spore-drive

## Projectile FTL

Similar to instant FTL, only ships "zoom off" in the specific direction of travel.

This type of FTL can usually be followed, as the destination of the ship is known.

Seen in:
 - Stargate hyperspace
 - Star Trek Warp-drive
 - Star Wars Lightspeed
 - Farscape starburst

## Gate drive FTL

Gate drives exist on the ships themselves, and they must generate a stable hyperspace window
for the ship to travel through.

This type of FTL usually requires a stable and quiet environment, and the ship departs slowly into the
hyperspace window.

Seen in: 
 - Homeworld

## Portal FTL

A physical portal exists which things can travel through.
The portal itself does not move, and the items do not have FTL capabilities.

Seen in:
 - Tachyon: The fringe
 - Stargate

# FTL Travel

Travel between two locations also follows two general patterns:

## Instant Travel

Travel between locations is instantaneous - no ground needs to be covered and the ship simply disappears and
reappears.

Instant travel cannot be intercepted along-the-way, as there's technically no journey.

Navigation is more difficult with this type of jump, as the course cannot be corrected. 
Prediction of star and planet locations is necessary, and it's possible to mis-calculate the destination.

Seen in:
 - Battlestar Galactica
 - Star Trek Spore-drive

## Ballistic Travel

Ballistic travel required physically moving between destinations, simply at an incredibly fast speed.

This kind of travel takes time, can be done at different speeds, and can be halted anywhere along
the journey.

This mode of travel can also be inhibited, and multiple ships can travel together.

Seen in:
 - Star Trek Warp-drive
 - Star Wars Lightspeed
